# Idea

- Just a local simple monorepo build
- No docker images, registries, repos
- Evaluate feasibility of Bazel as a build tool for incremental, reproducible builds and tests
- Evaluate Bazel query functionality for sparse checkouts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIJ99lkSdM
- One level above "bazel-golang-minimal-example": https://github.com/HappyCerberus/bazel-golang-minimal-example
